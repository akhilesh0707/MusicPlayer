# MusicPlayer
Music player app in Android using the MVVM architecture. This app will have a similar design as Spotify and it will also be designed in a way that is easily extendable with more features.

## Tech Stack:
* [RX Java][1] A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM.
* [RX Kotlin][2] RxJava bindings for Kotlin.
* [RX Android][3] RxJava bindings for Android.
* [ViewModel][12] - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
* [LiveData][4] for reactive style programming (from VM to UI).
* [Dagger2][5] for dependency injection.
* [Retrofit][6] for REST api communication.
* [OkHttp][14] HTTP client that's efficient by default: HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket
* [Gson][13] used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and vice versa.
* [Timber][7] for logging.
